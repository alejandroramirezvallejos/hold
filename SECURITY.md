# Security Policy

UCB Hold handles user identity, administrative actions and equipment loan records. Security issues should be reported privately and handled with enough context to reproduce and remediate them safely.

## Supported Versions

| Target         | Support     |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Latest release | Supported   |
| `main` branch  | Supported   |
| Older branches | Best effort |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use GitHub Security Advisories when available:

<https://github.com/ucbscz/hold/security/advisories>

If advisories are not available, contact a maintainer listed in the README through a private channel.

Include:

| Field         | Details                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Summary       | Short description of the issue and affected area.                        |
| Reproduction  | Steps, inputs, account type and environment needed to reproduce.         |
| Impact        | What data, permissions or workflow could be affected.                    |
| Evidence      | Logs, screenshots or proof-of-concept details, without exposing secrets. |
| Suggested fix | Optional remediation notes if known.                                     |

## Disclosure Rules

| Do                                         | Do not                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Report privately first.                    | Publish exploit details before maintainers can respond. |
| Share only the access needed to reproduce. | Access or modify unrelated data.                        |
| Request permission before automated scans. | Run aggressive scans against shared infrastructure.     |
| Remove secrets from screenshots and logs.  | Include tokens, passwords or private keys in reports.   |

## Response Targets

| Step               | Target                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Acknowledge report | Within 7 business days                          |
| Initial triage     | After reproducibility and impact are understood |
| Remediation        | Prioritized by severity and operational risk    |
| Public advisory    | After a fix or mitigation is available          |

## Secret Management

Never commit credentials, production connection strings, JWT secrets, private keys, database dumps or backups. Use environment variables, `code/server.env` for local Docker execution, or `dotnet user-secrets` for local backend development.

JWT access and refresh tokens are transported only in path-scoped `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookies and are `Secure` in production. They are not returned in response bodies or stored in browser storage. Refresh tokens are hashed in PostgreSQL, rotated on use and revoked at logout.

ASP.NET Data Protection keys are encrypted with external production key material supplied at runtime. Its generation, rotation, recovery and backup locations belong in a private operational runbook with restricted access; none of that material or those procedures belong in Git, CI artifacts or releases.

GitHub releases contain only `code/database/schema.sql`, generated with `pg_dump --schema-only` and validated to contain no table data. Operational backups, Data Protection keys, user documents and exported contracts remain in restricted private storage.

If sensitive material reaches Git history, treat it as a security incident and follow the private response runbook. Do not document affected values, internal locations or incident-specific remediation details in this public repository.
